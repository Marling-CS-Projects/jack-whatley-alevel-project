# CYCLE 6 Character Handler v1

## Design

### Objectives

In Cycle 6 I wanted to create a basic character handling system, using classes, so that in the next few cycles I can work on characters and gameplay. This also meant that I needed to create a test map so that I can have something to work with as I am programming in the gameplay.

The basic character handler will involve using classes and also a function at the end of the game.js file to make sure that their position is updated every frame. However I will also need to implement a system that makes it consistent as I do not want the game to run slower or faster on different frame rates as it currently does now.

* [ ] Create a test map.
