# CYCLE 9 Final Patch

## Design

### Objectives

In Cycle 9, the final patch, I wanted to polish the game to the point where all the current features work consistently. I also wanted to add a number of small features that could be implemented in time and that would add and improve the gameplay.

* [ ] Fix Character / Enemy mesh issues.
