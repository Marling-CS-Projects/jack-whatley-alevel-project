# CYCLE 4 Room Generation v2

## Design

### Objectives

In Cycle 4 I wanted to make sure the room generation for corridors worked perfectly on both axes and that the floor for the junction class of room was working. To do this I added an optional part to the generateCorridor() function from Cycle 3 which rotated the parts of corridor 90Â°; this wasn't so simple though as I had to make sure the parts of the corridor lined up correctly in the z axis.

I also had to create the basis of the generateJunction() function which would allow me to create the floor generating element now; and then allow me in future cycles to work on the generation of the walls of junction.

* [x] Add rotation to the generateCorridor() function.
* [x] Test that it is working with multiple examples.
* [x] Begin work on the generateJunction() function.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name      | Usage                                                          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Corridor           | The class for storing all the elements in a corridor.          |
| room, room2, room3 | The variables used for testing that the rotation of corridors. |
| wallHeight         | The constant used to keep the height of walls the same.        |

### Pseudocode

```
function generateCorridor(size, colour, position, rotation) {
    floor = createCube(size, colour)
    floor.setPosition(position[0], position[1], position[2])
    
    wall1 = createCube(size[0], wallHeight, size[1], colour)
    wall2 = createCube(size[0], wallHeight, size[1], colour)
    
    wall1.setPosition(position[0], position[1], position[2])
    wall2.setPosition(position[0], position[1], position[2])
    
    corridor = new Corridor(floor, wall1, wall2)
    
    return corridor

}
```

## Development

I started by creating a degrees to radians function as THREE handles rotation in radians, however it was more intuitive for me to just rotate it 90 degrees. This meant I had to look up the formula for converting degrees to radians which in javascript is `degrees * (Math.PI / 180)`. I then added this to my exports.js file so I could import it into the main.js file.

I then experimented in the main file with just some basic rotations of the corridor I created in [CYCLE 3](cycle-3-room-generation.md), that lead to some of the images that can be seen below in the Challenges section. However once I had it working (I ended up making a better position solution which used the local position of the floor and its width to align it perfectly) I added it to the generateCorridor() function.&#x20;

This involved adding another element to the function when parsing it, so if it sees "z" input into it, it rotates the corridor 90 degrees onto the z axis and repositions the walls.

I also began work on the generateJunction() function, only the floor for now as I would have to create a lot of walls if I was to fully make it in this cycle. This meant creating a new function and importing it: to do this I made a similar function to that of the corridor one and then I only added the floor for now.

I then added it to the scene to check that it worked and it correctly imported and appeared with the colour.

This shows some of the major changes to the file but not the file in its entirety as it is quite long at this point.

### Challenges

One of the challenges I face was getting the corridor to rotate correctly, with earlier attempts being out of alignment or further ahead/behind on the z axis. I was able to overcome this effectively by trial and error which also allowed me to come up with a solution that would work for all corridor shapes and sizes.

![When initially just rotating, the walls would rotate inside each other.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1).png>)

![After some experimenting I managed to get one wall lined up.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)

## Testing

In Cycle 4 I needed to test that the corridor was generating correctly, that it would rotate in the Z axis and that the junction floor was generating correctly in the correct colour.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                               | What I expect                                                        | What happened                                            | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Create a new corridor and check if it generates correctly. | The corridor will generate in the x axis with everything inline.     | The corridor generates with everything in place.         | Pass      |
| 2    | Generate a corridor on the z axis.                         | The corridor is correctly rotated and lined up.                      | The corridor is generated correctly.                     | Pass      |
| 3    | Generate a new junction floor.                             | The junction floor will be in the right place with the right colour. | The floor appears in the right place and correct colour. | Pass      |
