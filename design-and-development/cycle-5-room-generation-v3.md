# CYCLE 5 Room Generation v3

## Design

### Objectives

In Cycle 5 I wanted to complete the basic room generation so I could work on different things such as creating a map. This meant I had to complete the junction generation function from [CYCLE 4](cycle-4-room-generation-v2.md) and test that it worked for all sizes so that I could work on a map in the next cycle.

I also wanted to make sure that I have tested everything I have worked on so far, so that I can focus gameplay more in the next cycles. Rather than working on exclusively the level design or a spectator tool.

* [x] Finish the Junction Generation function.
* [ ] Test the junction generation function for all possibilities.
* [ ] Test the corridor generation function for all possibilities.
* [ ] Make sure everything works.
