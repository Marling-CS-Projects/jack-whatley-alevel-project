# CYCLE 7 Separate Screens

## Design

### Objectives

In Cycle 7 I wanted to start making the game less of a testing ground and more like a game. This means adding in more of the game logic and also creating the separate screens; these are the map screen and the individual room screens.

I also wanted the game to be able to handle new features in the future like procedural generation with less work needed. Therefore I also wanted to create a system that would do all the generation for me when provided with an array of rooms.

* [ ] Create a class for the map; that stores rooms and functions.
* [ ] Create a function that generates the map scene.
* [ ] Create a function that generates all the individual room scenes.
* [ ] Make the map screen simple looking.
