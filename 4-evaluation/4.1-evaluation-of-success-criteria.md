# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Criteria

| Ref Number | Description                               | When was it achieved  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1          | Game should run without crashing          | CYCLE 9               |
| 2          | Minimum of 60FPS whilst playing.          | CYCLE 1               |
| 3          | Game is easy to learn and hard to master. | See Usability Testing |
| 4          | Horror / Intense Atmosphere.              | Not met               |

### Criterion 1

As mentioned in [3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md#criterion-1) the game does have bugs however there is only one truly game breaking bug; this was caused by me forgetting to remove one of the imports from `exports.js`. However now that this is fixed there are no game breaking bugs, and now that this was one that it was impossible for the player to cause.

This means now that there are still a few remaining issues:

* Whilst in the scene view for individual rooms, it is possible to still interact with the MAP elements despite them being in a separate scene. This is due to the elements being in similar places despite being in different scenes; it is either a problem of THREE.js or the DomEvents library that I have used.
* The Camera is not perfectly aligned above the MAP scene meaning that it is possible to click on the edges of the cubes and not trigger anything. This is caused by the camera not being orthographic (fully top down) however this causes more errors if it is orthographic/
* The Window Resize function only works one way, meaning that if the screen gets larger it adjusts, but if the screen gets smaller it instead creates scroll bars. This is because of the default CSS overflow property being set as scroll.
* The UI in the top right overlaps with the very top of the map screen depending on the size of the users monitor. This is due to the UI being fixed in the top right position, this is a problem with THREE as the UI is a built-in module.

### Criterion 2

As demonstrated in some of the videos in cycles like [Cycle 9](../design-and-development/cycle-9-final-patch.md#video-evidence) the FPS always runs at 60 or above no matter the device it is being used on. In fact depending on the machine it's on it can run faster at FPS like 144. It is decided by whatever the users monitor supports and most modern monitors now support 60 and above.

### Criterion 3

The game was supposed to initially scale in difficulty as the player became more adept at the game and also contain more advanced mechanics for players who played a lot. However due to time a lot of these more advanced mechanics were not implemented as it would have taken too long to implement.

### Criterion 4

As mentioned in criterion 3 a lot of the more advanced mechanics that were planned were not implemented because of time. This includes adding atmosphere to the game such as sound effects and also making the game feel more like a horror game; therefore the game is sadly lacking a true horror game atmosphere.

## The Enemy

### Criteria

| Ref Number | Description                 | When it was achieved          |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 5          | Functioning behaviour tree. | Partially achieved in Cycle 8 |
| 6          | Turn Based Movement         | Cycle 8                       |
| 7          | Up and Down Time            | Partially achieved in Cycle 8 |

### Criterion 5

Giving the enemy character a full behaviour tree would have been extremely difficult given the constraints of THREE.js and having to create a whole framework for my game before being able to add much actual gameplay. Therefore, this feature is only partially implemented as the enemy does patrol around part of the map; however, it is not fully implemented as the behaviours are limited to patrolling and attacking the player.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/enemy-patrol-path.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The rooms the enemy patrols are inside the red square.</p></figcaption></figure>

Moreover, the way the patrol system works is based off of the system used for controlling which rooms are connected. The enemy will pick a random room to go to from the first two connected rooms in the room data; due to the corridor that goes right being the third one in the array the enemy never looks at that as a potential route. Again, showing how the enemy doesn't have true "AI" and meaning again that this is only partially implemented.

### Criterion 6

This feature was successfully implemented in Cycle 8 as it was much easier to make the game somewhat turn based for both the player and the developer's sake. As mentioned in Cycle 8 the way this works is that the player and enemy both have separate turn objects that store who's turn it is and then whenever the player does an action they switch.

Also of mention is that if the enemy were to move every turn then the game would be impossible to lose therefore there is only a 40% chance the enemy moves.

### Criterion 7

The idea was, similar to that of Alien: Isolation, that the game would have up and down time to give the player some time to recover after just having a stressful experience. This was only partially implemented as the player can retreat to certain parts of the map as respite from the patrolling enemy however this doesn't apply to the whole map and is therefore only partially implemented.

## The Character

### Criteria

| Ref Number | Description         | When was it achieved     |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 8          | Turn Based Movement | Cycle 8                  |
| 9          | Interactivity       | Cycle 9                  |
| 10         | Clarity             | Partially met in Cycle 6 |

### Criterion 8

As with the enemy's turn-based movement, this was achieved in Cycle 8, as mentioned above in the [Criterion 6](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-6) section.

### Criterion 9

This was achieved in Cycle 9 as the issues with moving one mesh between two scenes was resolved by simply having two meshes for both the Character and Enemy.

### Criterion 10

This was partially met in Cycle 6 where the character handler was created as this introduced the two separate placeholder meshes for both the character and enemy. This was partially met as it is possible to tell the two meshes apart however as these are placeholder assets the game is still missing some visual clarity.

## Level Design

### Criteria

| Ref Number | Description           | When it was achieved     |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 11         | Looping Level Design  | Not met                  |
| 12         | Clear Layout          | Partially met in Cycle 7 |
| 13         | Procedural Generation | Not met                  |

### Criterion 11 & 13

Looping level design and procedural generation were some of the more advanced aims that I had set for myself; however, I had set these aims before I had realised the limitations of THREE and before I recognised the amount of work it would take to get to the point the project is currently at.

### Criterion 12

This was partially met in Cycle 7 as the map screen made the layout of the game a lot clearer, however the same point remains as brought up in [Criterion 10](4.1-evaluation-of-success-criteria.md#criterion-10). A lot of the issues with visual clarity stem from the fact that the game is still using placeholder assets; however, I think it is clear enough for now.

## Visuals

### Criteria

| Ref Number | Description        | When it was achieved |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| 14         | Room Visuals       | Cycle 7              |
| 15         | HUD Visuals        | Cycle 3              |
| 16         | Accessible Visuals | Cycle 9              |

### Criterion 14

In Cycle 7 the separate screens were introduced, this improved the visuals a lot compared to what they were before where everything was in the same scene. Especially as the background is now black because otherwise the renderer won't work. However as mentioned above these could always be improved by having actual assets made by an artist for them; but at the moment they meet the requirements for visual clarity.

### Criterion 15

Despite previously mentioning issues about the HUD overlapping the map slightly on smaller monitors it still works well on the screens it was made for. Especially after improvements made in Cycle 3 where CSS was used to force the element over to the top right corner as before there was a margin on the right.

### Criterion 16

Despite having played around with things like having a glitch effect or bloom; these were all removed as it made the game's visuals better and simpler. These changes also mean the game is accessible as there are no flashing lights on screen or glitch effects.
