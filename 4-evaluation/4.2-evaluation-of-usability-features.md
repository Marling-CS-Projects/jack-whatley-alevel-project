## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                    | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash.                        | Success         |
| 2           | The games bugs don't make the game unplayable. | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

The game is error tolerant when talking about crashes as the game does not crash at all whilst playing and this is an important feature to take forward.

### Feature 2

Whilst the games bugs don't make the game unplayable and don't cause the player to get stuck in a place where they can't make progress. This is only a partial success as some of the bugs can be quite annoying, such as being able to click on the map rooms despite them not being visible in the room scene.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | List of controls in the settings menu. | Success      |
| 2           | Buttons in game describe what they do. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The game was somewhat easy to learn partially due to the fact that the controls were simple and that all of them were visible inside the options menu.

### Feature 2

The game was also somewhat easy to learn again due to the buttons in game describing what they do; however, despite this being a success it could always have been improved. For example, there could be some text on screen that describes how and when the buttons should be used rather than the player having to work them out themselves.
