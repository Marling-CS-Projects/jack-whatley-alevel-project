# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                            | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Clear goal on how to complete the game | Partial Success |
| 2           | Clear idea of how to avoid enemy.      | Fail            |

### Feature 1

This was a partial success as players were unsure how to complete the game in [3.2](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md) and there is also only one condition for completing the game and that is losing.

### Feature 2

There is not enough gameplay in the game at the moment that would give players an idea of how to avoid the enemy, so this was a failure.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                   | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Easy to navigate menu and UI. | Success      |
| 2           | Controls are concise.         | Success      |

### Feature 1

The menu is easy to navigate and simple as is the HUD as both are made up of just a few buttons so this feature was successful.

### Feature 2

The controls are made up of one button, that being only the left mouse button. Therefore, the controls are concise as they are very simple.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description             | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Enemy Behaviour Tree    | Partial Success |
| 2           | Environment Interaction | Fail            |
| 3           | Game Art                | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

This was a partial success as the enemy having a behaviour tree was meant to make it feel like the player was competing against a learning creature. However, this was only a partial success as the enemy only has two behaviours: patrolling and attacking.

### Feature 2

This was a failure as the idea was to have the player be able to use their character to interact with the environment and use this to gain advantages over the enemy. However, as players pointed out in 3.2 there is a lack of advanced gameplay mechanics.

### Feature 3

Despite the use of placeholder assets as mentioned in 3.2 players responded positively to the look of the game: especially the look of the Map scene. This was still a partial success though due to the difficulty some players had in identifying their character.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                    | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash.                        | Success         |
| 2           | The games bugs don't make the game unplayable. | Partial Success |

### Feature 1

The game is error tolerant when talking about crashes as the game does not crash at all whilst playing and this is an important feature to take forward.

### Feature 2

Whilst the games bugs don't make the game unplayable and don't cause the player to get stuck in a place where they can't make progress. This is only a partial success as some of the bugs can be quite annoying, such as being able to click on the map rooms despite them not being visible in the room scene.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | List of controls in the settings menu. | Success      |
| 2           | Buttons in game describe what they do. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The game was somewhat easy to learn partially due to the fact that the controls were simple and that all of them were visible inside the options menu.

### Feature 2

The game was also somewhat easy to learn again due to the buttons in game describing what they do; however, despite this being a success it could always have been improved. For example, there could be some text on screen that describes how and when the buttons should be used rather than the player having to work them out themselves.
