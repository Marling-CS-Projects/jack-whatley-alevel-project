# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To assess the usability of my game as shown in the [Design Frame](../2-design-and-development/systems-diagram.md#usability-features) I created a survey so as to assess whether users found my game met all of these five key points below.

| Test               | Test Details                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know what the win condition is? Do you know how to beat the enemy?  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Is the menu structure simple? Are the controls easy to use?                |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you like playing the game? Do you like the look of the game?            |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game crash? Are there any bugs you have encountered?              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Could you find where the controls were? Did you know what to do initially? |

Below this I had gone through all these key points and what the players thought about them below so I can judge whether I met these objectives.
