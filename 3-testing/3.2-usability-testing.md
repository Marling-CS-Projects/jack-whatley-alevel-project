# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To assess the usability of my game as shown in the [Design Frame](../2-design-and-development/systems-diagram.md#usability-features) I created a survey so as to assess whether users found my game met all of these five key points below.

| Test               | Test Details                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know what the win condition is? Do you know how to beat the enemy?  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Is the menu structure simple? Are the controls easy to use?                |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you like playing the game? Do you like the look of the game?            |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game crash? Are there any bugs you have encountered?              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Could you find where the controls were? Did you know what to do initially? |

Below this I had gone through all these key points and what the players thought about them below so I can judge whether I met these objectives.

### Effective

### Efficient

### Engaging

### Error Tolerant

### Easy to Learn

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

| Ref Number | Description                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3          | The game should be easy to learn and hard to master.                                   |
| 10         | The player should be easily able to tell which character is theirs.                    |
| 15         | The user interface should be clear so as to not cause confusion for the player.        |
| 16         | The game should not contain anything such as flashing lights or extremely loud noises. |

### Criterion 3

To encourage all types of players to play the game, the game should be easy to learn for more casual players. But also contain harder mechanics for players who play more of it than the casual player.

### Criterion 10

It is important for the player to know which character they are controlling otherwise the game would be confusing.

### Criterion 15

The UI is important as the player can control a lot of the game from there and it is important this as clear as possible, so the player doesn't become frustrated.

### Criterion 16

To make the game more accessible I wanted to make sure there was nothing like flashing lights or extremely loud sounds as this could affect some user's ability to play. Moreover, it would mean the game would have to be scary in different ways, rather than just overloading the user's senses.
