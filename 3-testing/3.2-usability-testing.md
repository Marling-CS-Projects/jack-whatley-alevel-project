# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To assess the usability of my game as shown in the [Design Frame](../2-design-and-development/systems-diagram.md#usability-features) I created a survey so as to assess whether users found my game met all of these five key points below.

| Test               | Test Details                                                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you know what the win condition is? Do you know how to beat the enemy?  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Is the menu structure simple? Are the controls easy to use?                |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you like playing the game? Do you like the look of the game?            |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game crash? Are there any bugs you have encountered?              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Could you find where the controls were? Did you know what to do initially? |

Below this I had gone through all these key points and what the players thought about them below so I can judge whether I met these objectives.

### Effective

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/bdAXs51aUfYaGAjTH9nmAkJhS03LN1NRM75Qds1qtqVqhiJQ9Jne5wu2znNWC__4wy3UuQKskNmjBC4ZpeaKzuGZq8ENb2bLsjobgMjGNihnRLuVhC4OnuFcPFMIsfMzxlAm-5gld8gaLRj2jfmBwGTF05K2STWO7XoT_WtTnP91LpFa7kAZi3Qfbg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Some players were unsure as to how to complete the game and this is understandable as the game is missing some of the criteria due to time. Meaning that in this respect the game needs improvement.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cm1ng_62WzZA3I9f4gtJqujQTfFmCnA_prw1nQx_DI3FfHhViYSYDhYwAheQ0CDYG8_PLEM9iKUhTBtz7rEs_imNw9eS67dwWfPkmHFECkm-Pdrn4W4qUJSuGIY4Zs6Be8iX8bCwYpg6pX9KyUG2GA4pv75kvtCk9cD4pkt-69oWfukvkxHFS7-i1w" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Again, due to the time contraints of the game, the game lacks clarity about things such as how to beat the enemy. So, it is understandable that players are unsure what to do.

### Efficient

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gY2zTtpkIbJ9hmzS8weyOUiHnjELlwfMCtwK9-TSUx1xkifpWvZXVFLXq5JZyHKWZHtrDvIpHZL92c3ck2zdTWfRdjxLaX9vCfJYjfFnmqFsKgKMKKOWWt-O8QQW3vFRBpY_oFjPBaEUCr421UnvFXoR-YkM4BdXvef_EgZ1kaxhuc2scV6OoSpETg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of the key points from early on was to make sure the menu structure is simple and helpful to make the game easy and intuitive for players. This makes it clear that they noticed that.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oXf5XzMdmSgWXsBJVBuVwQOt8xxXZeTEKtJzCy_6sy2bA0CKMuDWruuA55rEKojchZZC6-5Ku6txdakx89w3rqRj2EDU-JFiNFhuYY7BWIy2K2Um_67gR3qrCB3AQAtb_L7-S1yQeQYNpWa4yQrDe_yiuFQ2NIHvocHXzfCzjRPrWHLem4qgSurEAA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another key point laid out early on was to have simple and easy controls to make sure the player found the experience intuitive. Players had mixed feelings about this as some thought the controls were simple whereas some didn't.

### Engaging

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zxF1RTl9ZRGvBLkVPpJxVuGyWYBPAu_BdCftoNWA7SraK2SIfiKXI_FPqBBaRf6-Xzjlu-exMhal9CMLdUxKO39Gi-EuAIA4SMiTd-NGz6cdIn6bLn4YfJmYs2flrJA71Zegvz7SCeffhLAxlG-gkfl858kkh6O7wad2JFw44RLJrkm0ZCxpHmqtXw" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of the problems that the game suffers from is having to have a lot of code made in the background due to the limitations of THREE. This has clearly affected the amount of gameplay and players had mixed feelings about the game, which makes sense with the current amount of gameplay.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OU4pb_4wh1nSn8if7BIyPfJ72ETjC02kPwhkQJCw1tK5rJpqs-vz_2dz8EaEADeKsQmuUTLZrCAi2SnAg3-ZKMXYgQ2YDam--lJGp-9zDfy19ImGZq-XLJEDoYsBp2LpP8b442X3qT2nRUyKtEb3K8gGksy8nDO81PFx1i_g1C2gnFh-id1HqK3CPQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Players responded positively to the games visuals which is surprising as most of the games assets are currently placeholder however this is a great positive.

### Error Tolerant

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I2prL417zT0slIEc1ZZNYZF2lHz7msPGharg6PkH9JSZH8K8OAo-diQ_W7yN2lUxv8p0scAyvk00EBQGL_EVFKPe7ZC3p7bFN4L1UcGEnLf2TragW_uR6Av1P1YBGYiteQOeYh2_eEVf2naqA4osJmmp0K2FHH-flAvysJE3JWH4CZuT5LLRqBqdRA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The players responses confirm the results in [3.1](3.1-robustness.md) as the game didn't crash at all for any of the players during their testing.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k2FTKr5RnfyW5epO0sHguKnnINpS0YjA8z-sI96ULCtReibJoZn13Pda7aQipIhJdBtnqpKNTdZo6jyRdA0jd55xfEl7S3pb3O_U2Jjuvfuqo3R733sFfpUPmgsjvZZNfc6p4MtzzethbLzbykMKe-2CLCq2kWYDFG_qzwWyJtJ8G1mRAQzrvHQu6A" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is understandable as I pointed out a number of bugs when talking about the robustness of the game in [3.1](3.1-robustness.md). Players most common listed bug was the one when viewing a room scene, you can still interact with the map.

### Easy to Learn

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aTb2dS8UCdmmuN0aER3pQqaFT1zM73XGSzPvGvp-FLCwsFV-21abq2jMw8PM1z9HMioWoj5CgjHQAvuhOAnwhkkVpvoc6MRPgvlHgw8yx0RAYZSPraB06eDcM1yoA2-PNLr59H49pptALxhfvn7vJD-LxsE6y4unM95oSYa1t-DPQ5uCp8s9kNSLzw" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Players found the game easy to learn meaning that all of the controls were successful as not only were they easy to use; they were also easy to work out.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TOxTcS2pXS1g_dM21f3FlJR5hiaCoYipYl_NuRA4C_9sNxzvqZrptLj3xr6zoRsWR5NStH4F9E8Esocm_mKYUghOWSdDGSD7WJsODdw7BPPwA59EInXso1bTrnKc00GE5LzsOAkTQqaAX8b4duSNfzncGUUjqcmKTIOOMaaV4UXBPAissayq1ELrCA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Understandably as like the previous questions a number of players were unsure how to beat the enemy or beat the game. Again, this is also related to time and the games lack of advanced gameplay.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

| Ref Number | Description                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3          | The game should get progressively harder.                                              |
| 10         | The player should be easily able to tell which character is theirs.                    |
| 15         | The user interface should be clear so as to not cause confusion for the player.        |
| 16         | The game should not contain anything such as flashing lights or extremely loud noises. |
| 17         | The game should be around a Pegi 12 age rating.                                        |

### Criterion 3

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2VW9arStOeklTGqCt6qH9wr-cncru4RCs_kpqhhs_zpprQ82_c4kZ2MMjAucQHsCdsL-WIZtgGuZ89KYk0VuDdqGp21ydDb3T2nOIGKpzVvQrWU8nXyKIWdJCSVjQ0gaXbIi4pywqvOP7CjFvv_je0iS0bm1AiNEnheVYoErzB5ilDexOW2D0srjGg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As I have mentioned a lot above there is a lack of advanced gameplay so of course the majority of players felt that the game didn't get harder.

### Criterion 10

It is important for the player to know which character they are controlling otherwise the game would be confusing.

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gQ86MhYzxVydtL4aSHRojOKbnIm_CbqY6bfjm41fkJCCjM-dI_qOCg52kdhQ-G6fUVCR9aShaSCB1Cp-B9TE21NzW6vc0QvhVcd7KqMFEBu74re9UcEbF-TPVAOFwtbKp_UwTzgLuSd3pcY1orC5Ek8i3-j-L1ZJ5W3pC3xjqYA-kVR7B98G7Tqanw" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Despite the use of placeholder assets, the majority of players could understand which model was that of the characters. However, it would be better for there to be no doubt whatsoever so this could be improved with proper 3D assets.

### Criterion 15

The UI is important as the player can control a lot of the game from there and it is important this as clear as possible, so the player doesn't become frustrated.

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/06qfsyVP3Fb9Xb6C15RC2JRFPsw-XGXyoYfZXcQPVfLcVRKxoOWZLygiv6IW6rKJCX3AiZAk7PJ_tCepIGjIRMNmgXh2s8Y6MZWgs0eFLEv3fyUMbqDa3a_iWkyTvA0YYG0VErZn2APMqDrDLp67wtMoUzPNR5w5lOfptahYbx6lBL4v1ccSuhJRbQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Players thought that the UI was at the very least serviceable and some people thought that it was extremely clear and simple which means overall the UI design has been successful.

### Criterion 16

To make the game more accessible I wanted to make sure there was nothing like flashing lights or extremely loud sounds as this could affect some user's ability to play. Moreover, it would mean the game would have to be scary in different ways, rather than just overloading the user's senses.

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GEybpYuXu3GPBcn9HHB_vogqdLBvFA-jIbk0wOHitLEHgtr9YOVSfPCt3batNeYil-3g2L7ieaYyZKCiZMiUCIeo_Lta6m86er1d7-Y4WNV2KFDOxRww4pwRchveIApzovGKS-vekUwNZiHkmnK6NT-OzZuFmbbSMoXvkzyPjkaehizY_YyXeiek" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 17

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FNYyYHwpiR080LZC2DzVDwAJpe-Qm7UfcDP1fTMEfRZpyCLSLuhJSClp1Y3bCasYNUQQsoSas2fQzR3EijJJUIq0rEjx_wsVawcYUK5kNKefCXpHcFEMhBoneOo03emKMdVpC3qYBpF7pf1H0LWNpNmJQtG-EPhTGv4vMZFQC26uLyj6UZ5jL-VL" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Unsurprisingly the majority of players agreed with the age rating of 12 and the people who disagreed stated that it would likely be lower. Therefore, the game successfully met this criterion.
