# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

## [CYCLE 0](../2-design-and-development/cycle-1.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                                          | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1    | The server will start without error.                   | Pass        |
| 2    | Once connected to the server the menu is interactable. | Pass        |

## [CYCLE 1](../design-and-development/cycle-1-migration-to-three.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                                                      | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 3    | The game environment will render when I press the new game option. | Pass        |

## [CYCLE 2](../design-and-development/cycle-2-spectator-tool.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                                     | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2    | Clicking with the mouse will rotate the camera.   | Pass        |
| 3    | Pressing WASD will move the cube and camera.      | Pass        |
| 4    | Pressing the Shift key will move the cube faster. | Pass        |

### Evidence

Despite not being rendered, the spectator tool controls all still work and can be used in any scene which is extremely useful for debugging.

## CYCLE 2.5 - 4

Most of Cycle 2.5 was cut so there are no relevant tests for that; and Cycle's 3 and 4 built up to Cycle 5 anyway so there is no point in repeating those tests as they are included in 5.

## [CYCLE 5](../design-and-development/cycle-5-room-generation-v3.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                          | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | The corridors will generate correctly. | Pass        |
| 2    | The junctions will generate correctly. | Pass        |

## [CYCLE 6](../design-and-development/cycle-6-character-handler-v1.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                                     | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | The whole map is visible from the camera.         | Pass        |
| 2    | The character will move when the room is clicked. | Pass        |

### Evidence

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to how the project is currently configured this test is no longer repeatable however this video still serves as great evidence of it working. In later cycles the map is still visible however it looks different to this.
{% endhint %}

## [CYCLE 7](../design-and-development/cycle-7-separate-screens.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                                                     | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | The scene and camera switch without error.                        | Pass        |
| 2    | Clicking on a room moves the scene and camera to the correct one. | Pass        |

### Evidence

Once again this is harder to demonstrate through screenshots and therefore the videos used previously are still the best evidence of this test working.

## [CYCLE 8](../design-and-development/cycle-8-game-logic.md)

### Tests

| Test | What I expect                                                               | Pass / Fail |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | The right action will happen in the right turn. Moving or switching camera. | Pass        |
| 2    | The character will only be able to move to connected rooms.                 | Pass        |
| 3    | The enemy will randomly patrol connected rooms.                             | Pass        |

### Evidence

Will be included as part of Cycle 9.
