# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

In my section for [success criteria,](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) I made two key requirements that I must follow to make sure that my game is robust and functional. Meaning that it can play on any PC without crashing or other issues.

| Criterion | Description                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The game should not crash whilst the user is playing.          |
| 2         | The game should run at 60FPS the whole time it's being played. |

### Criterion 1

During all of my testing I have tried to enter as many erroneous inputs as possible and also just randomly press buttons and click around on the screen. The game does succeed in the criterion because it never crashes; however, this did allow me to discover a few issues with the game.

The Issues I found:

* Whilst in the scene view for individual rooms, it is possible to still interact with the MAP elements despite them being in a separate scene.
* If the exports.js file is importing some code I have deleted, then instead of causing an error it causes the program to link towards the missing URL. (Visible Below)
* The Camera is not perfectly aligned above the MAP scene meaning that it is possible to click on the edges of the cubes and not trigger anything.
* The Window Resize function only works one way, meaning that if the screen gets larger it adjusts, but if the screen gets smaller it instead creates scroll bars.

### Criterion 2

To measure the FPS I had made use of the Stats.js library as the THREE js documentation recommended this as an accurate measure. As mentioned in [Cycle 9](../design-and-development/cycle-9-final-patch.md#development) I made the FPS counter an optional addition and all the time during my testing the game has run at 60FPS; or more, depending on which computer I am using.

## CORS Error

Whilst the game runs on the server due to the way the browser requests work the game doesn't run if I just open the HTML page. This is because the server allows HTML to import as a module whereas this is blocked if I just try to open it. This means the game always needs to be player via a server which is fine as long as its web based.
