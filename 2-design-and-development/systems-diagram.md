# Design Frame

## Systems Diagram

![](../.gitbook/assets/system-diagram.png)

This system diagram shows all of the major features that I will implement into my game. They are broken down to reduce complexity and also to make development easier as I can focus on one section. This system diagram also combines the success criteria and the features of proposed solution into a more legible diagram.

## Usability Features

My game should try to be as accessible as it can be to most people, excluding those younger than the age rating. Therefore I will focus on making it suitable for the target audience and making sure that I create a fun user experience.

### Effective

It is important for the player to have ideas about what they want to do in the game and achieve them, especially as this game is sort of sandbox with only one basic fixed objective, survive.&#x20;

#### Aims

* Clear goal on how to complete the game.
* Clear idea of how to beat the enemy.

### Efficient

It will be important to have a clear and navigable menu structure to avoid user frustration and also to have a clear UI/HUD as players will rely on it to play the game and avoid negative outcomes.

#### Aims

* Easy to navigate menu and UI.
* Controls are concise.

### Engaging

It will be important to have engaging visuals especially as it is a horror game; it will also be important to have an enemy with a behaviour tree to ensure that the game has replay value and that will also drive environment interaction.

#### Aims

* Enemy Behaviour Tree.
* Environment Interaction.
* Game Art.

### Error Tolerant

To avoid frustration for the players it is important that the game has as few bugs as possible and that when they do happen, they don't affect the user's experience.

#### Aims

* The game doesn't crash.
* The games bugs don't make the game unplayable.

### Easy To Learn

It is important that the game be easy to learn and intuitive to play as the game is meant to cater towards both casual players and people who play more often.&#x20;

#### Aims

* List of controls in the settings menu.
* Buttons in game describe what they do.
