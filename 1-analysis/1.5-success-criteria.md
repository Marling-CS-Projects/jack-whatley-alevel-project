# 1.5 Success Criteria

### Non-Functional Requirements

| Reference Number | Success Criteria                  | Justification                                                                                      |
| :--------------: | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         1        | Game should run without crashing. | If the game crashes whilst playing it will become boring if the player has to restart.             |
|         2        | Minimum of 60FPS whilst playing.  | Most modern screens support 60FPS so it will enhance the viewing experience.                       |
|         3        | Easy to Learn, Hard to Master     | This will make the game more accessible but also have increasing difficulty to add more game time. |
|         4        | Horror/Intense Atmosphere         | This will appeal to people who like horror games and make the game more intense.                   |

### The Enemy

| Ref Number | Success Criteria           | Justification                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------: | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      5     | Functioning Behaviour Tree | Having a learning enemy will increase the tension as the player will have to adapt to something that is learning from their actions.                               |
|      6     | Turn Based Movement        | If the enemy was able to move the whole time whilst the player is exploring it will feel unfair and the player will struggle to have time to explore rooms fully.  |
|      7     | Up and Down Time           | Having up and down time will increase the tension as the player will not know when the enemy will hunt them but also they need some guaranteed down time to relax. |
