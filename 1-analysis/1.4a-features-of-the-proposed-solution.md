# 1.4 Features of Proposed Solution

## Level Layout & Design

The levels in my game will consist of two screens; one of these will be the map view where the player can see the whole map and the other will be the room screen where the player can interact with their characters and experience semi-random events.

### Map Screen

![The camera screen from FNAF.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

The map screen will involve the player being able to look across the whole level and being able to see all rooms; they will also be able to interact with all of the rooms which will lead them to the room screen which will be mentioned below.&#x20;

There will also be a number of interaction on the map screen, for example, the player will be able to scan for the creature however this will radiate out from where the characters the player controls are and it will alert the creature to their general area.

### Room Screen

The room screen will be what the player sees when they click on a room from the map screen and it will allow them to interact with objects (only in the room with controllable characters) it will also allow semi-random events; for example, if the enemy finds the room the player will have a short time to pick from three options i.e. hide, fight or attempt to lock the door. The outcome of which will be affected partially by chance but also if the enemy has learnt certain behaviours which will be mentioned below.

## Mechanics

This section will discuss the features of the game and how the player will interact with the environment and the enemy in it.

### The Enemy

![A screenshot of part of the behaviour tree from Alien: Isolation.](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

This will be one of the main focuses of the game as mentioned in the research section Alien: Isolation was one my main inspirations and the behaviour tree the Alien has is part of that and I would like to develop that for this section.

The enemy will have a behaviour tree that will unlock more features depending on how much the player uses a certain feature to evade it, this will stop the player abusing one feature to make the game easier. This will express itself in a number of ways:

* Lockers - Once the player has ordered their characters to hide in lockers too often the enemy might begin to realise this and it will unlock a new ability to search lockers, it may progress to it searching multiple if the player keeps using it after it unlocks this ability.
* Fighting Back - If the player tries to play the game like a shooter and tries to kill the enemy (which is not possible) the enemy may learn to be less scared of the player attacking it and it may start to fight back and then run away, eventually learning to just kill the player characters.
* Locking the Door - Again if the player tries to use the door to keep the enemy out it might learn to start to attack the door in an attempt to get through and eventually learn how to get through the door.

However it is important to consider things such as the player having down time and also making sure the enemy doesn't learn from behaviours that result in the player getting killed otherwise it might cause the player to get stuck and not be able to progress.

#### How did Alien: Isolation do it?

To sum up [this](https://becominghuman.ai/the-perfect-organism-d350c05d8960) article: the alien gradually learns behaviours in the tree throughout the game; however none of the conditions from these events lead to the players death as this would be unfair. The Alien also has points of interest (POIs) to investigate to give the player the impression of it hunting and it also backtracks to make it seem to the player that it is doubting itself and going back to search other areas. Another key point is that the AI system never cheats, it never really knows where the player is and never teleports.[(Thompson, 2017)](../reference-list.md#1.4-features-of-proposed-solution)
{% endhint %}

### The Characters

The character will be what the player controls in this game and they will be the ones at risk of dying to the enemy as they can be killed by it; this means the loss condition will be when all of the characters are dead. The player will be able to control where they move and where they are will affect what the player is able to interact with, this makes logical sense as the player shouldn't be able to access items in a room where there are no characters.

The victory condition will be to get the characters to safety, this will be complete once at least one character has reached safety and if only one makes it the player will have a low score to reflect how they got all but one of the characters killed; there will also be a time rating and a rating for the number of interactions survived with the enemy.

The characters will as mentioned above be able to be killed by the enemy however it may first start by injuring them and they will have three states for simplicity: healthy, they will be normal and not at risk of dying; injured, actions will take longer and if they do too much whilst injured they may die; dead, the character is dead they can't do anything anymore.

### The Environment

There will be a number of items around the environment that the player can interact with and there will also be a number of items the characters can find to help them:

<details>

<summary>Environment Objects</summary>

There will be a number of environmental objects in rooms that both the characters and the enemy can interact with:

* Chairs - Characters when not performing an action might default to sitting on a chair as a default animation.
* Tables - May have useful items on top depending on the room and can also be hidden under; however the enemy may learn to search under them.
* Lockers - May have even more useful items such as weapons or armour and will provide a better hiding spot. But, these will be rarer than tables and again the enemy may learn to search them.
* Doors - These will provide access to other rooms and they might have a chance to be damaged and not work, moreover, they will be lockable if the player has access to certain systems but the enemy may be able to break through.
* more need to be added

</details>

<details>

<summary>Useful Items</summary>

There will be a number of items that will allow the player to have an easier time navigating the environment, these will be in a number of categories.

Weapons and armour \[to be added] which will allow the player to drive back the enemy:

* Pistol - This will be a simple starter weapon with common ammo that will allow the player to survive early and have a backup weapon for later; however the enemy will take more and more shots as the game goes on to make it flee.
* Stun-Baton - This will allow the player to disable the enemy temporarily for a limited time however it will be a one use item and it will be very rare encouraging the player to save them.
* Flamethrower - This gun will cause the enemy great fear and it will run away immediately after being fired for a short time, however the ammo will be rare and the player will only unlock it later in the game.

Medical items will allow the player to heal their characters:

* Bandage - Will only half-fix the injured state but will be decently common in comparison to the next item.
* Medical Kit - Will fully heal the character from the injured state in a shorter time than two bandages but will be rarer than a bandage.

Miscellaneous items will allow the player alternate options to progress:

* Computer Interface - This will allow the characters to interact with terminals which could allow them to lock doors and have control over other systems in the environment.

## Computational Methods

Computational thinking is:

> Computational thinking allows us to take a complex problem, understand what the problem is and develop possible solutions. We can then present these solutions in a way that a computer, a human, or both, can understand. [(BBC, 2019)](../reference-list.md#1.4-features-of-proposed-solution)

Using the computational methods will allow me to create an efficient and useful solution. This will be useful in my project because:

* The player characters will not need to eat and the game will be taking place on a space station but not simulating gravity therefore it will not be a realistic simulation of real life.
* Computational methods will allow the player to save and load their progress quickly and the game feel the same to them after loading a save file.
* There are details the player will not need to see yet will make their experience of the game more interesting for example how advanced the enemy is along the behaviour tree and what it has unlocked as this would effectively spoil the game for them.
* It will be important for the game to have a clear UI as the characters will be at risk meaning that the player could loose the game if the UI is poorly designed as they might miss key information.

### Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction means simplifying the experience to make it easier to understand for example the Tube Maps in London. This is important when creating a game as it allows focus on the core features of the game which will streamline the user experience and make it more fun. The key features I will focus on will be:

* The Behaviour Tree - This will be the main driver of the game with the AI either harassing the player or giving them downtime; it will also learn new behaviours to keep the game more challenging and interesting but not too many behaviours otherwise it may be too complex.
* Graphics - The graphics only need to be 2D as the focus will be on the challenge from the enemy and the game only needs a certain strong style rather than 3D graphics to look decent.
* User Interface - The user interface should be clear and communicate all the information available to the player otherwise it could result in the characters dying for no reason and that would feel unfair.
* Level Design - The levels need to be simpler but also feel claustrophobic like the corridors of a space ship as this will add to the creepy atmosphere and things like camera view will be limited as this will also add to the intensity.

### Thinking Ahead

It will be important to plan out my time to make sure I stick to schedule and it may also be beneficial to make a Gantt chart like I have for EPQ. It will also be important to not set myself unachievable goals; despite looking for inspiration from Alien: Isolation if I try to compare my work to that of a professional team of developers I will always be unsatisfied with the product I make.

![A rough Gantt chart that I will follow and update as I continue throughout my project.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

### Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

I will also be using decomposition to make the project simpler to build and make as it will be important to plan out and make a flow diagram and hierarchy chart as it will allow me to plan out my project in detail and make it more organised. Making a hierarchy chart will also allow me to break up the project into small sections which I can make into different cycles hence why above I have put rough timing as some cycles (and modules) may take longer.



### Thinking Logically



### Thinking Concurrently
