# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Level Layout & Design

The levels in my game will consist of two screens; one of these will be the map view where the player can see the whole map and the other will be the room screen where the player can interact with their characters and experience semi-random events.

### Map Screen

The map screen will involve the player being able to look across the whole level and being able to see all rooms; they will also be able to interact with all of the rooms which will lead them to the room screen which will be mentioned below.&#x20;

There will also be a number of interaction on the map screen, for example, the player will be able to scan for the creature however this will radiate out from where the characters the player controls are and it will alert the creature to their general area.

### Room Screen

The room screen will be what the player sees when they click on a room from the map screen and it will allow them to interact with objects (only in the room with controllable characters) it will also allow semi-random events; for example, if the enemy finds the room the player will have a short time to pick from three options i.e. hide, fight or attempt to lock the door. The outcome of which will be affected partially by chance but also if the enemy has learnt certain behaviours which will be mentioned below.

| Room Screen   | <p>The room screen is where the majority of the gameplay will take place with the player able to interact with their characters or elements in the room and experience events.<br><br>• Choice Box - This will allow the player to experience events and react in one of three ways either by clicking 1, 2 or 3 or by clicking the options.<br>• Click - This will allow the player to interact with objects in the room such as storage lockers and they will be able to select which items they take or how they interact with something like a light switch.</p> |

## Mechanics

This section will discuss the features of the game and how the player will interact with the environment and the enemy in it.

### The Enemy

![A screenshot of part of the behaviour tree from Alien: Isolation.](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

This will be one of the main focuses of the game as mentioned in the research section Alien: Isolation was one my main inspirations and the behaviour tree the Alien has is part of that and I would like to develop that for this section.

The enemy will have a behaviour tree that will unlock more features depending on how much the player uses a certain feature to evade it, this will stop the player abusing one feature to make the game easier. This will express itself in a number of ways:

* Lockers - Once the player has ordered their characters to hide in lockers too often the enemy might begin to realise this and it will unlock a new ability to search lockers, it may progress to it searching multiple if the player keeps using it after it unlocks this ability.
* Fighting Back - If the player tries to play the game like a shooter and tries to kill the enemy (which is not possible) the enemy may learn to be less scared of the player attacking it and it may start to fight back and then run away, eventually learning to just kill the player characters.
* Locking the Door - Again if the player tries to use the door to keep the enemy out it might learn to start to attack the door in an attempt to get through and eventually learn how to get through the door.

However it is important to consider things such as the player having down time and also making sure the enemy doesn't learn from behaviours that result in the player getting killed otherwise it might cause the player to get stuck and not be able to progress.

#### How did Alien: Isolation do it?

To sum up [this](https://becominghuman.ai/the-perfect-organism-d350c05d8960) article: the alien gradually learns behaviours in the tree throughout the game; however none of the conditions from these events lead to the players death as this would be unfair. The Alien also has points of interest (POIs) to investigate to give the player the impression of it hunting and it also backtracks to make it seem to the player that it is doubting itself and going back to search other areas. Another key point is that the AI system never cheats, it never really knows where the player is and never teleports.[(Thompson, 2017)](../reference-list.md#1.4-features-of-proposed-solution)
