| Map Screen    | <p>The main portion of the game will not take place on this screen however the controls will still be important as this is how the player will navigate the ship and how they will track the enemy.<br><br>This will involve the player being able to click on sections of the map and this will zoom them into the room. They will also be able to perform a scan that will radiate out from where the characters that the player is controlling are.</p> |
