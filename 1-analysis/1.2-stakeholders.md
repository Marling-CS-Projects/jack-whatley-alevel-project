# 1.2 Stakeholders

### Stakeholders



### PEGI Rating

This game will be aimed towards PEGI 12 and above as the majority of players are above this age and I would like to add elements that may not be appropriate for an audience younger than 12. For example elements of horror and complex mechanics that may not be appropriate.

The PEGI description for PEGI 12 is as follows:

> "Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild." (PEGI, 2017)

My game will involve slightly graphic violence, as there is an element of danger for the player, however because it is 2D it will be limited and there is no need to warrant anything above a PEGI 12 rating. Moreover there will be nothing sexual as it is not relevant to the game's setting or plot and the swearing will be limited and likely only used in brief.

Below are the likely Age Rating and Content Descriptors of my game, based on the PEGI ratings above:
