## Game Research

I have researched a number of games that I will take inspiration from and certain features from that I can hopefully learn from to improve my game.

### Alien: Isolation

#### Overview

This game, based on and following the events of the 1979 film Alien, involves the player attempting to investigate a space station that has fallen into disrepair due to the Alien on board. The Alien has an advance system to control the difficulty and make sure it only harasses the player at certain points.

#### Mechanics

The game involves the player playing in first person, using their tracking device to work out where the Alien is and then working out if it is safe for them to complete the mission they have been given. There are ways for the player to fight back as well for example the player gains access to guns or a flamethrower however these can only temporarily delay the Alien as it is unkillable by the player.

The Alien is also controlled by two systems that make the player feel like they are in the actual Alien film itself. To explain this the first system is a general controller it knows where the player is and where the Alien is and it knows when the player is on a mission and needs downtime or if the Alien should harass the player; and the controller has the power to direct the Alien towards the general area of the player, however, the Alien has to find the player itself which is where the second system is used.
