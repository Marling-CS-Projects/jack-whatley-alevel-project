# 1.3 Research

## Game Research

I have researched a number of games that I will take inspiration from and certain features from that I can hopefully learn from to improve my game.

### Alien: Isolation

#### Overview

This game, based on and following the events of the 1979 film Alien, involves the player attempting to investigate a space station that has fallen into disrepair due to the Alien on board. The Alien has an advance system to control the difficulty and make sure it only harasses the player at certain points.

#### Mechanics

The game involves the player playing in first person, using their tracking device to work out where the Alien is and then working out if it is safe for them to complete the mission they have been given. There are ways for the player to fight back as well for example the player gains access to guns or a flamethrower however these can only temporarily delay the Alien as it is unkillable by the player.

The Alien is also controlled by two systems that make the player feel like they are in the actual Alien film itself. To explain this the first system is a general controller it knows where the player is and where the Alien is and it knows when the player is on a mission and needs downtime or if the Alien should harass the player; and the controller has the power to direct the Alien towards the general area of the player, however, the Alien has to find the player itself which is where the second system is used.

The second system involves the Alien having a system of sensors and also a behaviour tree, the sensors allow it to see and hear the player and the behaviour tree unlocks new behaviours depending on the more the player does an action. For example, if the player hides in lockers too much it will "learn" to check them by unlocking a node in the tree; it can also learn to be less scared of the flamethrower as it "learns" that the player can't kill it if the player uses the flamethrower on it too much.

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unkillable Enemy                 | The concept of an unkillable enemy which you can only drive away temporarily add lots of tension and is perfect for a horror game.                                                                                 |
| Behaviour Tree                   | The enemy being able to learn adds difficulty and tension to the game as the player will not know what the enemy will do next.                                                                                     |
| Enemy Exclusive Traversal System | The Alien in Alien: Isolation is able to move around using a system of vents and this would again add tension to the game as it could give the player downtime whilst also setting up the opportunity for a scare. |

| Features            | Justification                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3D Graphics System  | The game I am making is 2D due to it being easier to work with and it will allow me to focus on features like the behaviour tree.        |
| Alien Two System AI | As mentioned above the Alien has a director system and a behaviour system whereas for a simpler 2D game I will be able to combine these. |
| Other Enemies       | I do not need other enemies featuring similar behaviour trees as it will be easier to focus on one and develop it as much as possible.   |

### Five Nights at Freddy's



#### Overview

This game features a security guard working at a Pizza Place where the waiters and entertainers are animatronic robots. The game takes place at night time with the security guard in his office looking over the place with cameras and attempting to survive the animatronics coming into his office and murdering him by stuffing him into an animatronic suit.

#### Mechanics

The game involves the player sat in the security office and checking cameras and closing doors in order to prevent the animatronics for killing them. The gameplay loop is effectively check cameras then check outside the office doors with lights and if there is an animatronic there then the guard needs to shut the door.&#x20;

There is also a limited resource which is the offices power which adds more tension as closing the doors and using the lights and cameras drains the power and when the power is out one of the animatronics appears outside the left door and waits around 20 seconds before attacking and unless it turns 6am in that time then the player dies.

The animatronics also have differing systems to control them for example the first FNAF game features four main animatronics; they also vary in aggressiveness and speed with one being able to run quickly down the corridor to the office, however that one is scared of cameras and will not attack when the player is using the cameras.

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Map Overlay + Cameras | For my game having a map with cameras will allow the player to see what is going on in the room their characters are in and it will allow them to monitor the enemy.                                                                       |
| AI Levels             | In FNAF the AI has a level ranging from 1 to 20 and this dictates how aggressive they are and this would be a good way to implement ramping difficulty; and also to give the player down time.                                             |
| Horror Thematics      | In FNAF the game features audio design that creates an atmosphere of tension and the cameras are incredibly blurry and offer only a limited view of the danger approaching the office which would be a good way to add tension to my game. |

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2D/3D Style Graphics       | FNAF uses a strange mixture of 2D and 3D elements and despite this working for FNAF it would be unnecessary for this game and wouldn't fit the style.                  |
| Player Danger              | In FNAF the player themselves is in danger from the enemies however this will not work for my game as the player is supposed to be directing people who are in danger. |
| Multiple Dangerous Enemies | There are multiple unkillable enemies in FNAF however for simplicity it would be easier to have one and also to focus on its behaviour system.                         |
