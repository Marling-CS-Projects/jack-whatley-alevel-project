# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## User Requirements

The game will be browser based using a javascript library for an engine which will be either [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) or [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/). This means that the requirements for the game will involve an up to date web browser that supports Javascript and can run it well. Furthermore the most popular web browsers in 2022 are as follows: Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Moreover other browsers such as Edge and Opera are common as well (Marqueses, 2022) so it will be important to cater to all of these as long as they support the features used by Kaboom or THREE.
